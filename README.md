# Omron-GUI
Omron V680S-HMD63 Interface

This is a small project to interface the Omron V680S-HMD63 commercial RF read/write module with a Windows computer. The project encompasses
a library for the computer-module interface and a py file for a simple GUI. Much of the code is still very dirty and it was a "quick fix"
to have the project up and running.
